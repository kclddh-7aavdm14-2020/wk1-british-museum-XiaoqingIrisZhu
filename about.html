        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <img src="me.jpeg" width="150" height="200">
        <p>Hello everyone!</p>
        <p>My name is Zhu Xiaoqing, you can call me <strong>Iris</strong>. My major in university is hospitality management, which is not related to the media mostly. Because of my interest, I chose to intern in the public relations department of a boutique hotel, mainly responsible for social media. During the internship, I visited many different websites, which made me want to create a website I like, so I chose this course.</p>
        <p>Song art museum is one of my favorite museums. Its design is elegant. Unfortunately, it has no official website, but I found a report for your reference.

        <p>Besides, I like photography very much. I hope to have a chance to see the photo exhibition together in London.</p>
        <p>I am now in Guangdong Province, China. I will arrive in the UK in late October. Looking forward to seeing you all!</p>
